# tower-defense-game

Shadow Defend is a tower defence game where the player must attempt to defend the map from
enemies using towers. As such, there are two main components of the game: slicers (the enemy),
and towers.

Towers are manually purchased by the player and can be placed on a non-blocked area of the map.
There are diﬀerent types of towers, each with diﬀerent characteristics, but the overall goal of a
tower is to prevent slicers from exiting the map.

Slicers are the main antagonists of the game. They spawn at varying points during a wave. Like
towers, there are diﬀerent types of slicers, each with diﬀerent characteristics, but the overall goal
of a slicer is to reach the ‘exit’ of the map.

When the game begins, the ﬁrst level is loaded and rendered, the buy panel and status panels are
rendered, and $500 starting cash is awarded to the player as shown in Figure 1. The player can
set up their ﬁrst defensive tower (if they want) and then when they’re ready, they can press ‘S’ to
initiate the ﬁrst wave of enemies.
